Overview
This project showcases a simple bash script created as part of my journey to becoming a Linux Systems Administrator. It demonstrates how to automate repetitive administrative tasks, like backing up important user documents, using shell scripting on a Linux system.

Learning and mastering basic scripting is essential not only for system administration but also for achieving operational efficiency and maintaining strong system security practices.
