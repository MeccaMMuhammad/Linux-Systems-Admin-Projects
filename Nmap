# Nmap scan to discover open ports
nmap -Pn 192.168.0.2

# Aggressive scan for ports 80, 443, and 3306
nmap -Pn -A -p 80,443,3306 192.168.0.2

# Re-run Nmap to ensure the ports are closed
nmap -Pn 192.168.0.2
Conclusion:
By closing unnecessary open ports, we reduce the attack surface and improve the security posture of the system. This exercise helped me understand the importance of port management and how to use Nmap for vulnerability scanning.
