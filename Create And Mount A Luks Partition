Tasks Completed Per Line
Line 1 command-line disk partitioning utility used in Linux to create,modify, and delete disk partitions
* Note see ppt on linked in for visual of cfdisk menu/creating partition size etc. 
Line 2 Initializes a LUKS encrypted partition, setting up encryption parameters, and creating a passphrase to secure the partitio
Line 3 Opens and decrypts the LUKS-encrypted partition located at /dev/sda4, making it accessible and mapping it to the device name my_luks_partition under /dev/mapper/
Line 4 Creates a Ext4 filesystem on the LUKS-encrypted partition, allowing it to be formatted and used for data storage 
Line 5 Creates a directory named "my_encrypted_partition" in the "/mnt" directory, providing a location to mount the my_luks_partition encrypted partition
Line 6 Mounts the LUKS-encrypted partition, decrypted and accessible through the device mapper, to the directory "/mnt/my_encrypted_partition", allowing access to its contents
Line 7 Displays information about block devices,including their UUIDs and file system types, /dev/sda4 will be listed as having a filesystem TYPE="crypto_LUKS"
Line 8 Lists block devices and their associated filesystem types, provides information about the filesystems present on each block device.
