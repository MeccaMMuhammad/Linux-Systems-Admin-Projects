Tasks Completed Per Line
Line 1 Creates a directory file_encryption
Line 2 Changes the directory to file_encryption/
Line 3 Creates a file called myStuff.txt with the content "important stuff here". 
Line 4 Shows a list of available commands for OPENSSL
Line 5 AES-128CBC which is a symmetric encryption algorithm where data is divided into blocks of 128 bits and encrypted using a secret key and also uses CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode, each plaintext block is CORed with the previous ciphertext block before encryption which enhances security by introducing feedback into the encryption process
Line 6 Enter and verify password for file 
Line 7 Will verify that the file is created 
Line 8 Verifies that the file is not readable with the concatenate command thus ensuring its confidentiality 
Line 9 Decrypts data using OpenSSL, the -d option indicates decryption mode
Line 10 Enter Password
Line 11 Shows the decrypted file now being readable to authorized users who possess the correct key.
