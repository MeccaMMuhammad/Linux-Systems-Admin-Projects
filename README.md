🔍 Analyze Malicious Activity Lab
Lab Focus: Brute Force Attacks, Command Injection, SYN Flood Attack Detection

🧠 Objective
This lab simulates real-world attack scenarios and teaches how to identify malicious activity through indicators of compromise (IoC) using common cybersecurity tools and logs. Recognizing and responding to these indicators is crucial for any cybersecurity or Linux system admin professional.

🚀 Why This Lab Matters on My Linux Systems Admin Journey
As an aspiring Linux Systems Administrator, understanding how malicious actors exploit systems and how to recognize signs of these attacks is essential. This lab enhanced my hands-on skills with:

Attack detection using event logs

Brute force techniques against SMB

Command injection vulnerabilities in web applications

Creating and identifying reverse shells

SYN flood DoS attack observation using Metasploit

Being able to recognize and respond to these threats is foundational in defending Linux-based infrastructure in real-world environments.
