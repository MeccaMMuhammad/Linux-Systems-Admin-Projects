## ⚡ Exercise 1: Identify LM Hash Vulnerabilities

### 🛠️ Objective:
Simulate legacy password storage risks and demonstrate how to extract and crack LM hashes using Linux tools.

### 🧪 Steps:
1. On **ACIDC01**:
   - Enabled LM hash storage in Group Policy:
     ```
     Computer Configuration ➝ Windows Settings ➝ Security Settings ➝ Local Policies ➝ Security Options ➝ Network Security: Do not store LAN Manager hash value ➝ Set to "Disabled"
     ```
   - Forced policy update with:
     ```
     gpupdate /force
     ```

2. Verified LM hash generation by creating a test account and setting a weak password.

3. On **ACIKALI**, used **Impacket’s secretsdump.py**:
   ```bash
   sudo secretsdump.py aci.local/Administrator:'Passw0rd'@192.168.0.1
Extracted the LM hash and cracked it using John the Ripper:


john --format=LM hash.txt

🌐 Exercise 2: Identify DNS Zone Transfer Vulnerabilities

🛠️ Objective:
Create a DNS record, test DNS zone transfer security, then intentionally misconfigure the DNS server to demonstrate how data leakage can occur.

🧪 Steps:
On ACIDC01:

Opened DNS Manager ➝ Forward Lookup Zones ➝ aciplab.com ➝ Right-click ➝ New Alias (CNAME)

Alias: testing.aciplab.com

FQDN: aciplabtestingserver.com

On ACIKALI, attempted a zone transfer:


sudo dig axfr @192.168.0.1 aciplab.com

Result: Transfer failed (expected behavior)

Back on ACIDC01:

DNS Manager ➝ Right-click aciplab.com ➝ Properties ➝ Zone Transfers ➝ Enable "Allow zone transfers" to any server

Retested on ACIKALI:

sudo dig axfr @192.168.0.1 aciplab.com
Result: Transfer succeeded

Observed: SOA, CNAME, and other DNS records

🎯 Learning Outcomes

✅ Extract and crack LM hashes using Linux tools

✅ Configure DNS Servers and create resource records (CNAME)

✅ Test and secure DNS against zone transfer vulnerabilities

✅ Gain comfort with Impacket, John the Ripper, and dig
